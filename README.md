##  Overview of the analysis
  Help a journalist researching UFO sightings build a webpage using javascript and HTML to document UFO sightings for enthusiasts around the country.
  This website will have an interactive table that will be filterable on multiple critera to showcase different sightings using a database. 

##    Results

    This is what the website looks like. We have built a webpage using html coding, and have used javascript to upload a 
    database that can be filtered among 5 different parameters.

    As can be seen, by narrowing the search parameters to san diego, the database has narrowed to only sightings in 
    san diego california!
I used .css file to edit the design of the webpage alongside html coding. Due to the dark background, we are using white text for better readability, and have also added a simple header image. 
##    Summary
One of my bigger drawbacks is that you cannot search by one specific month. You must search by a specific date. This can
be quite frustrating when you want to find sightings in March, but would have to do 31 individual inputs to do it. 
There are other issues I ran into. One of the bigger ones is that the search bar did not seem very forgiving to 
capitalization errors. If I typed in "San Diego" instead of "san diego" nothing would come up. I also think the fact that 
you must manually refresh the database is a little dated. It'd be better for the database to update as you type. This would require looking at the user input by the character and seeing what matches that input.
